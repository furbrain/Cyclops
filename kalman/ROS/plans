So ... we're going to use ROS!
It already has most of the stuff we need like camera calibration, camera to camera calibration and
camera -> IMU calibration.

ORB SLAM3 plays with this setup and I need to look through to see if we can use
monocular + RGBD (can mimic this with lidar + normal cam) + IMU + (?? magnetometer...)

Consider adding a "IMUM" mode for the IMU which incorporates the madgwick algorithm...

May need to install a C++ IDE (bleurgh...)
